Directory:
../

// Because or program is doing all the grunt work of differentiating the logs (in terms of 
// date and time, office, request etc.), there is no reason to complicate the directory in
// which they're being stored. The entire database is being loaded into our data structure
// when the program initializes, and it will pull the XML files from the main directory.
