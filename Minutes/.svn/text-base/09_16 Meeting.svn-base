	Q: Do you want just a log or do you want more?

  -we could take a trip to the office and ask some of those who work in the office if they have any input.
  
Brain-stormed Ideas:
-ticket based system (think IT help ticket style)
-some fields should be locked for office use only
-can we possible use the Canisius system for logins?
-MySQL and XML(recommended but not what we must use, good idea)
-Trash function? there logs would we even need this?
-Merge Function? - could be very difficult..
- how should we allow multiple people to work on requests?
		->could use a lock on each request? (TRUE /FALSE if locked?)
		->need to allow multiple requests to be submitted to database as well
		

GUI: NOTE>>> THE UI MUST BE ABLE TO BE CHANGED EASILY WITHOUT MODIFICATION TO PROGRAM
tabs for databases?
... need questions answered & a better understanding of what the customer needs...

HELP PAGES: 
-we need to document how to use the program( lame man terms)
